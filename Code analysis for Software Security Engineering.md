# Code analysis for Software Security Engineering



## Part 1
  
A short summary of your code review strategy.What challenges did you anticipate and how did your code review strategy attempt to address those challenges?

Each teammember reviewed fewer than 200 lines of code at a time.And analaysed and revied our code using SonarQuobe scanner tool  Take enough time for a proper, slow review, but not more than 60â€“90 minutes. Be sure that authors annotate source code before the review begins. Establish quantifiable goals for code review and capture metrics so you can improve your processes.


Findings from manual code review of critical security functions identified in misuse cases, assurance cases, and threat models.

Findings from automated code scanning (if available). Include links to full reports.


## Part 2
 
Summary of key findings from manual and/or automated scanning. This summary should include mappings to CWEs to describe categories of major findings.

Planned or ongoing contributions to the upstream open-source project (documentation, design changes, code changes, communications, etc.) These can be based on any of the prior assignments in the class.
