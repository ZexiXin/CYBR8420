###general requirement of the project
> This is a group assignment. It is to be completed in collaboration with your project team.

Project Proposal: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:

Name of an open-source software project your team has chosen to work on. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”.
Describe a hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software.
Provide a diagram that identifies the systems engineering view (Links to an external site.) of the software in the hypothetical environment. 
What are the threats perceived by users of the software in its intended operational environment? (If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your project selection.)
Develop a list of security features in the software (Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice).
Team motivation for selecting this project.
Open-source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc. You can get some of this information from Github or OpenHub (Links to an external site.))
Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreements (Links to an external site.)
A brief summary of security-related history for the software (E.g., known vulnerabilities, security-related engineering decisions, security feature additions/removal, etc. ).
Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task. 
Github Project Boards (Links to an external site.)
Include a reflection of your teamwork for this assignment. What issues occurred? How did you resolve them? What did you plan to change moving forward?
