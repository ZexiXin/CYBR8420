### **General requirement of the project that are copied from Canvas**
### Project Proposal: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:
1. Name of an open-source software project your team has chosen to work on. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”.
2. Describe a hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software.
   * Provide a diagram that identifies the systems engineering view (Links to an external site.) of the software in the hypothetical environment. 
   * What are the threats perceived by users of the software in its intended operational environment? (If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your project selection.)
   * Develop a list of security features in the software (Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice).
3. Team motivation for selecting this project.
4. Open-source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc. You can get some of this              information from Github or [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/))
5. [Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreements.](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#orienting-yourself-to-a-new-project)
6. A brief summary of security-related history for the software (E.g., known vulnerabilities, security-related engineering decisions, security feature additions/removal, etc. ).
7. Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task. 
   * [Github Project Boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)
   
8. Include a reflection of your teamwork for this assignment. What issues occurred? How did you resolve them? What did you plan to change moving forward?
