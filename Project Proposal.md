# Project Name: **Crocodaille**
Croc is a software that can safely transfer data and files from one computer to another.It uses a relay-assisted peer-to-peer transactions and end-to-end encryption via password-authenticated key exchange. This allows data to be shared fast, easy and most importantly secure.

## Hypothetical working environment
The users well expect full functionality from their homes.Sender and receiver will  have full access to what's going on simultaneously.

## Team Motivation

At the beginning stage, we didn’t have a concrete direction to explore for the open source project, so our team has looked through some other groups’ projects from previous years. To be honest, it helped us to narrow down our view somehow. Hence, we tried to search for some recent hot topics relative to cybersecurity.  After two hours of online meeting, there are 5 alternatives that can satisfy our interests. Then, to make everyone can really work on it, we started analyzing the detailed information in each topic area. For example, achievability of the topic, availability of relevant sources, usability in the community and modifiability of program. 
Based on the above evaluation, Croc is the best choice for us. 

## Project Description 
The project is an open source project that enables us to transfer data to one computer to another, **simultaneously**. Using a safe and secure function called **crocodile**. Crocodile is function(algorithm) that uses a three step **transaction** process:
1. relay-assisted peer-to-peer 
2. end-to-end encryption 
3. via password-authenticated key exchange

## Software History 
* Peer-to-peer networks often utilize relay nodes to provide various networking services. These services include the traversal of Network Address Translator (NAT), content search , application level multicasting and medium caching ..

* End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation

* Password-authenticated key exchange are two entities, who only share a password, and who are communicating over an insecure network, want to authenticate each other and agree on a large session key to be used for protecting their subsequent communication. This is called the password-authenticated key exchange problem.
